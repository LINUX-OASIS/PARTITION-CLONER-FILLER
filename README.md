An interactive TUI (Text-based User Interface) script for cloning, growing, and copying EXT4, BTRFS, and FAT32 partitions with ease and power.

---

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive TUI:** Uses `whiptail` for a user-friendly, menu-driven experience.
*   **Multiple Cloning Methods:**
    *   **Block-Level Clone (`dd`):** A raw, bit-for-bit clone for any filesystem type. Perfect for creating an exact replica on a partition of the same or larger size.
    *   **Filesystem-Level Copy (`rsync` / `btrfs`):** An intelligent copy that only moves data, not empty space. This allows you to "clone" to a smaller partition, as long as the data fits!
*   **Filesystem Resizing:** Automatically expands EXT4 and BTRFS filesystems to fill the partition after a `dd` clone. Also includes a standalone resize tool.
*   **Safety First:** Multiple confirmations and clear warnings before any destructive action. Includes a countdown timer before `dd` operations.
*   **Dependency Check:** Verifies that all required tools are present before running.
*   **Robust Cleanup:** Safely handles temporary mount points and cleans up after itself, even if the operation is aborted.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

> This script performs **DESTRUCTIVE** operations. All cloning and copying methods will **IRREVERSIBLY ERASE ALL DATA** on the selected destination partition.
>
> **PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION.** The maintainer is not responsible for any data loss.

## üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility

This script is designed for Debian-based Linux distributions and should work on:

*   Debian
*   Ubuntu
*   Linux Mint
*   Other Debian/Ubuntu derivatives that use the `apt` package manager.

While it may work on other systems, it is only officially supported on these platforms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

The script requires several common command-line utilities to function. It will automatically check for them when you run it.

**Required commands:**
`whiptail`, `lsblk`, `awk`, `grep`, `dd`, `btrfs`, `resize2fs`, `sync`, `fsck.vfat`, `mktemp`, `df`, `rsync`, `mkfs.ext4`, `mkfs.vfat`

If any dependencies are missing, the script will notify you and exit. You can typically install the packages that provide these tools on a Debian-based system with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install whiptail coreutils util-linux awk grep btrfs-progs e2fsprogs dosfstools rsync
```
